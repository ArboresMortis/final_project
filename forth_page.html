  <h1>Things I am willing to fight people on.</h1>
  <h3>Comic Sans is what is wrong with the world, and without it, we would have world peace.</h3>
  <p>While Comic Sans may have been acceptable in decades past, it is inexcusable to be using it in 2019. It's use is a travesty, and in my opinion should be a crime.</p>
  <p>Others may think this is a dumb hill to die on, but I will fight to the end to prevent this scurge from further proliferating.</p>
  <p>I believe Comic Sans is the mark of evil, and all uses by anyone under the age of sixty should be viewed as declarations of war.</p>
  <p>I will be linient in regards to grandparents using the font, if it can even be called that, because they have no way to know better.</p>
  <p>It's great that they figured out how to change the font, and we should be happy for their acomplishments.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, if I find Comic sans on anyone else's site, I can no longer be your friend.</p>

  <h3>Ya'll need to apreciate chocolate more.</h3>
  <p>As a sad, sad soul who cannot eat chocolate due to an unfortunat alergy, I believe the chocolate eaters in the world need to better apreciate chocolate.</p>
  <p>It is a rare day that I have the delicious treat, and I find it insulting when folks decide they don't like something because it has too much chocolate.</p>
  <p>You ungreatful wreches need to learn how good you have life, and should learn to not take the last vanilla cupcake because there is someone who cannot have chocolate for a medical reason and she would really like to have the chance to actually participate in birthday celebrations once in a while.</p>
  <p>It's especially rude when I litterally reminded you yesterday that I was alergic, so could you please make sure that a surger cookie was left over so that I wouldnt be left out, and you give it to the person three seats away and they take a bite before I can say anything.</p>
  <p>You know who you are.</p>
  <p>You should be ashamed.</p>

  <h3></h3>
