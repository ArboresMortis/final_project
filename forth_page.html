  <h1>Things I am willing to fight people on.</h1>
  <h3>Comic Sans is what is wrong with the world, and without it, we would have world peace.</h3>
  <p>While Comic Sans may have been acceptable in decades past, it is inexcusable to be using it in 2019. It's use is a travesty, and in my opinion should be a crime.</p>
  <p>Others may think this is a dumb hill to die on, but I will fight to the end to prevent this scurge from further proliferating.</p>
  <p>I believe Comic Sans is the mark of evil, and all uses by anyone under the age of sixty should be viewed as declarations of war.</p>
  <p>I will be linient in regards to grandparents using the font, if it can even be called that, because they have no way to know better.</p>
  <p>It's great that they figured out how to change the font, and we should be happy for their acomplishments.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, if I find Comic sans on anyone else's site, I can no longer be your friend.</p>

  <h3>Ya'll need to apreciate chocolate more.</h3>
  <p>As a sad, sad soul who cannot eat chocolate due to an unfortunat alergy, I believe the chocolate eaters in the world need to better apreciate chocolate.</p>
  <p>It is a rare day that I have the delicious treat, and I find it insulting when folks decide they don't like something because it has too much chocolate.</p>
  <p>You ungreatful wreches need to learn how good you have life, and should learn to not take the last vanilla cupcake because there is someone who cannot have chocolate for a medical reason and she would really like to have the chance to actually participate in birthday celebrations once in a while.</p>
  <p>It's especially rude when I litterally reminded you yesterday that I was alergic, so could you please make sure that a surger cookie was left over so that I wouldnt be left out, and you give it to the person three seats away and they take a bite before I can say anything.</p>
  <p>You know who you are.</p>
  <p>You should be ashamed.</p>

  <h3>Ya'll are missing out on some banging music, check out this band.</h3>
  <p>Look, I just want to have somewhere to put some music by one of my favorite bands, so listen to this some by them.</p>
  //Insert song. You are loved? Midnight? Sleep when I'm dead? Link to a fifth page full of fangirl?

  <h3>Cursive is kinda dumb.</h3>
  <p>In the modern day, there is no use for cursive writing in the average life. It's simply harder to read, harder to write, and makes it more difficult to transfer information to a digital format.</p>
  <p>Public schools have started to take the sensible step of phasing out teaching cursive, because allmost all modern writings are done in plain text, so they are actually legible without having to learn a second alphabet.</p>
  <p>Using plaintext is also much easier for a computer to do, because it doesn't have to deal with extra rules on how to connect things together. They already have enough trouble with languages like arabic, lets give them a break.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the extra time taken to teach cursive could be better spent on doing things like math, or teaching kids reading conprehention, or science, or a million other more useful topics that aren't cursive.</p>

  <h3>Ya'll can be used as a singular, and ya'll can't stop me.</h3>
  <p>All you language prescriptivists need to stop complaining, because the english language is gonna move along without you. You can sit there complaining, but we aren't going to limit the language simply because it 'Isn't proper'.</p>
  <p>You lost the battle the moment we started using words like google as a verb, or the family of verbs including yeet, kobe, and other things used to increase the functionality of a throw. Each generation adds new vocab, and it's a shame you can't understand us, but pick up a dictionary.</p>
  <p>Language is a growing thing, and all ya'll'd've known that if you went outside for even a moment. Oh yeah, quadruple contractions are also something I will use til the day I die, and if you have a problem with that, come at me.</p>

  <h3>Psychonauts is a great game.</h3>
  <p>Look, I'mma fangirl a bit more, k. It's a great game, ya'll should play it, a wonderful soundtrack, best twist this side of candycanes, just overall a masterpiece.</p>
  <p>If ya'll wanna talk about this game with me, go ahead because I've been waiting for the sequel for a while, and I wanna talk about my boy Raz.</p>

  <p>Or just watch this great playthrough.</p>

  <h3>If ya'll don't stop asking me to teach you 'cool moves', I will fight you. Literally</h3>
  <p>I am sick and tired of everyone who learns I do martial arts asking for me to teach them. I am not qualified to teach you, you have not signed a contract absolving me of responsibility, no. I ain't doing it.</p>
  <p>If you want, I am willing to let you see me do a bit of practice, but if it doesn't look cool, you won't apriciate the show moves and how useless they actually are.</p>
  <p>If you ask me to do a specific kick, and cannot do a simple roundhouse kick with proper form, or cannot proform a punch without breaking your fist, I will assume I should never show you any martial arts because You will fail, and your failure will get me in trouble.</p>
  <p>For liabilities sake, I am required to say you should not try what I do because I have had years of practice, along with likely being a wildly different weight, body type, and hight, making any attempts to exactly replicate my actions likely to lead to injury.</p>
