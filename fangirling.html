  <h1>This is just mad rambling, so turn back now if you respect yourself.</h1>
  <h2>Psychonauts</h2>
    <p>I love this game with all my heart. I've been following the speedrun community for the game for several years, and watched times drop by over an hour.</p>
    <p>I have watched the whole "All achievements run" and would not wish it on my enemies because it is way too long who would do that.</p>
    <p>I am absolutly awful at platformers, but I love this game. there is so much to explore, and every character is well fleshed out, it's art style is stunning, and I say you should play it.</p>
    <p>I also suggest playing the second psychonauts game that's coming out in '20, and the VR game Rhombus of Ruin, because there is even more amazing world building there and you should check it out.</p>

  <h2>Set It Off</h2>
    <p>I'm a sucker for good music, and I'm a sucker for artists who can pull of being a jack of all trades. This band is both.</p>
    <p>I've only followed them for a few years, and yes, I was first introduced by the song Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, but I know they are so much more than that.</p>
    <p>They just released their latest album Midnight earlier this year, and it continues to show how much of a range they have, from the first song to the last.</p>
    <p>They care about their fans, and though they have a relitivly small following, it's always fun to find someone else who listens to them, becuase you undoubtably know a few songs by heart.</p>
    <p>A smaller community is much more well knit, and I'm willing to vouch for this communities, even with some in fighting over who's a true fan, and the sometimes strange music videos.</p>

  <h2>Sander Sides</h2>
    <p>So this is less fangirling, and more a set of fan theories, so buckle up buttercup, we are in for a ride.</p>
    <h4>Deceit is Logan's opposite, not Patton's</h4>
      <p>Lets take a good look at why the fandom thinks Deceit is Patton's opposite.</p>
        <h6>1. He pretended to be Patton for his introduction.</h6>
        <p>While that would be great evidence if Patton was the only one he pretended to be, that just isn't true. Part of the reason why I don't think Deceit is Patton's opposite is because he's also taken over Logan. Considering we've only seen him in episode twice, I don't think we can use this evidence to say anything. Deceit might decide to take over either one of them next time, or he may never do it again.</p>
        <h6>2. Deceit is all about lying, while Patton is morality.</h6>
        <p>Two points here. Deceit is not just about lying, even though it is a big part of who he is. I think he's more self preservation, as he himself said. He's much more likely to use half truths, instead of compleatly lying, and it isn't like Patton has never lied. In fact, Patton decides to withhold information several times, like in DWIT when both he and Virgil try and repress Remus. Also as Patton himself said, he deals with Thomas's emotions, which I think is a much larger part of his character than morality. I think he cares about morality less for the sake of being good, and more because being good makes Thomas feel good.</p>
      <p>That's about all I can think of, which isn't alot, while I can think of many more reasons for Deceit to be Logan's opposite.</p>
        <h6>1. Deceit is immidietly found out when he tries to impersonate Logan.</h6>
        <p>It takes nearly a whole episode for Deceit to be reveiled when he pretends to be Patton, but it takes just a few lines for everyone to know he isn't Logan. It could be that the group is more on guard for Deceit after he first showed up, but I don't think that is entirely it. Logan is all for the compleat truth, and patterns, living up to his role as logic, while Deceit is winning at any price, which can be the compleat inverse of truth. </p>
        <h6>2. Logan is the one Deceit pushes to the back of the courtroom, not Patton</h6>
        <p>When Remus came out, his first action was to prevent his brother from speaking, and for good reason. Roman is the one side who best knows how to handle Remus, because they are opposites. Logan, being logic, is the best one to argue against Deceit, and so it only makes sense for him to be the one Deceit most wants gone. He knows Patton wouldn't be that hard to convince, just like he's easy to pretend to be, because they aren't that different from eachother.</p>
        <h6>3. Deceit is not emotional, with the most emotion he does display being in small outbursts, mostly of frustration.</h6>
        <p>Of all the sides, Logan is the least likely to show emotion, with his most emotional points being anger at Roman, and consistent anger at the idea of lying. They both get annoyed at others not listening to them and start repeating themselves, where Roman and Remus get loud, and Patton and Virgil shrink back and get quiet. It fits more that Logan's opposite would display the same kind of attitude as him.</p>
        <h6>4. Deceit is the act of repression, and Logan is the one to argue against repression.</h6>
        <p>Deceit is the one who hid "The Others" from Thomas, actively repressing his knowledge of them, while Logan is always in pursuit of knowing more. Deceit will purposly ignore certain facts to help his agenda, while Logan is always the one providing more information, and is the one side most likely to provide exposition. Logan also argues against repression in DWIT, even though he also represses his own emotions. </p>
        <h6>5. Deceit expects the others to behave rationaly.</h6>
        <p>As shown in both CLBG and SVS, Deceit has been using calls to athority and logic much more than calls to emotion, similar to how Logan argues his points. Along with this, when the others don't behave rationally, Logan starts to stutter, and Deceit simply looks afronted, because both of them are confused by the others not thinking in the same way they do.</p>
        <h6>6. They share a character arc.</h6>
        <p>The main problem both Logan and Deceit have is that the others don't listen to them. They seem to be sharing the same character arc of learning hoe to get the others to listen to them, and learning to listen to the others. Learning to not repress things. In LNTAO, Logan is all for repressing his emotions, pretending they don't exist, and in the course of a few episodes has compleatly flipped in opinion from what we've seen. Deceit too has changed drasticly from his initial appearence, and all the hints about him from the begining, being the force behind everyones repression, and argueing to stop repressing their desires and admit to what they want.</p>
        <h6>7. They both have some sort of speach difficulty.</h6>
        <p>While it is a very weak argument, it is interesting that both Logan and Deceit have issues when speaking sometimes. Logan has shown an almost compleat inability to understand or use metaphor, while Deceit has difficulty telling the truth when asked direct questions. The others metaphorically walk circles around them in normal conversation, but they are the best at debate, as shown in My Negative Thinking, and SVS.</p>
        <h6>8. They take the others to places outside of Thomas's apartment.</h6>
        <p>In My Negative Thinking, Logan takes Virgil and Thomas to a stage to hold a debate, similar to how Deceit takes the sides to first a theator and them a courtroom. They are the only sides to move the others without help, as when they traveled to Virgil's room they needed Thomas, just the same as when they made the short lived mind palace and when they went to Patton's room.</p>
    <h4>A list of possible names for Deceit.</h4>
      <h6>Nile</h6>
      <p>De-nile isn't just a river in Egypt.</p>
      <h6>Ethan</h6>
      <p>The last of the trio of Logos, Pathos, and Ethos. Deceit argues from the athority of the people he quotes.</p>
      <h6></h6>
