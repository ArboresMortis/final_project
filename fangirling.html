  <h4>Psychonauts</h4>
  <p>I love this game with all my heart. I've been following the speedrun community for the game for several years, and watched times drop by over an hour.</p>
  <p>I have watched the whole "All achievements run" and would not wish it on my enemies because it is way too long who would do that.</p>
  <p>I am absolutly awful at platformers, but I love this game. there is so much to explore, and every character is well fleshed out, it's art style is stunning, and I say you should play it.</p>
  <p>I also sujest playing the second psychonauts game that's coming out in '20, and the VR game Rhombus of Ruin, because there is even more amazing world building there and you should check it out.</p>

  <h4>Set It Off</h4>
  <p>I'm a sucker for good music, and I'm a sucker for artists who can pull of being a jack of all trades. This band is both.</p>
  <p>I've only followed them for a few years, and yes, I was first introduced by the song Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, but I know they are so much more than that.</p>
  <p>They just released their latest album Midnight earlier this year, and it continues to show how much of a range they have, from the first song to the last.</p>
  <p>They care about their fans, and though they have a relitivly small following, it's always fun to find someone else who listens to them, becuase you undoubtably know a few songs by heart.</p>
  <p>A smaller community is much more well knit, and I'm willing to vouch for this communities, even with some in fighting over who's a true fan, and the sometimes strange music videos.</p>
